# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



# My notes

This is my first react project that I created to learn some react. It is a simple one pager with a filter. There is probably a lot to be improved but again, it was my fist time creating a react app and I didn't have a idea for what it should do when I started. This frontend should work with the "Simple_WebAPI" that I made earlier in .net8.
